Here is the file I'll use for comments


Do not separate packages by interfaces and classes. 
Do use standard package names (no underscores) characters.  
Do not inlcude .classes (or the out) folder in the VCS - the general rule is to exclude anything that compiler generates.

Why two source level folders?

Make sure you name classes follow the standard convention. 

see:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html

packages are always lower case, no dashes, underscores
Class names always start with a Capital letter and use camel case. 
Method names always start with a lower case letter and use camel. 
Variables names awlasys tart with a lower case and use camel case.
